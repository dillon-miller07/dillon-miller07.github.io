## Project 1 – Graphing Calculator
This project is a Java-based graphing calculator that allows users to create and graph mathematical functions, including linear, quadratic, trigonometric, and exponential functions. The program also includes a built-in basic calculator for arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponents, and square roots. Users can customize graph bounds and dimensions and interact with the program through a menu-driven interface.

## Project 2 – Mandelbrot Image
This project visualizes the Mandelbrot set, a famous mathematical fractal created by repeatedly applying an equation using complex numbers. For each point on the screen, the program checks whether the values stay bounded or grow toward infinity. Points that stay bounded form the Mandelbrot set, and the others are colored based on how quickly they escape.

The result is a detailed, self-similar pattern that shows how a simple equation can create complex and beautiful designs.
