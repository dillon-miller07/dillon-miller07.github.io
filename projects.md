## Project 1 – Graphing Calculator
This project is a Java-based graphing calculator that allows users to create and graph mathematical functions, including linear, quadratic, trigonometric, and exponential functions. The program also includes a built-in basic calculator for arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponents, and square roots. Users can customize graph bounds and dimensions and interact with the program through a menu-driven interface.
