## About Me

I am a student at UW Eau Claire majoring in Computer Science. I enjoyy building projects, solving problems, and learning how software works behind the scenes. I’m interested in improving my programming skills through hands-on projects and coursework. This GitHub showcases my work as I continue to grow as a developer.
